# You are walking down the street and you come across a cafe.
# You are asked if you'd like to enter.

# If you enter you are asked what you want to order.
#   If you order juice you spill it on your shirt
#   If you order something something else happens
#   If you order a sandwich you happily leave on your way
#   If you order a coffee you burn your tongue.
# Eventually you're on your way again

# If you keep going you come to the street corner
# If you turn left 
#   You come across a robber and are asked to fight or flee 
#   If you fight
#   If you flee
# If you turn right
#   Then this happens
